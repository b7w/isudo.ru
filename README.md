# About
It is static blog generator. Like [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) or [liquidluck](https://github.com/lepture/liquidluck).
But I moved from my WP blog and need more back compatibility, so i wrote this. Very simple and minimalist.
With tune [inove](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/inove) template, thanks [mg12](http://www.neoease.com/).


# Why
WP blog is so slow, so complex and need too much attention. I think a lot what to do, where to move. And once I decided to write simple static engine for myself.
